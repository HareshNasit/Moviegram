## Introduction
In the MovieGram directory you can run the `npm start` command which will open the app and take you to the Home page of our app. 
The app is supposed to be a social movie review website where users can search for movie reviews as well as connect with other users with similar movie interests. 

## Setup
```
cd moviegram/
npm install
npm start
```
## How to use
* You will be directed to the Home page initially where a user has an option of searching for a pre-existing movie review or login to their account (if they have one) or signup for an account. 
* The signup page will ask you for your information but will not create an account for now.
* There are 3 pre-existing users User1, User2 and Admin.
* Username for User1 : username1
* Password for User1 : password1
* Username for User2 : username2
* Password for User2 : password2
* Username for Admin : admin
* Password for Admin : admin

* Once logged in a user can see movie reviews posted by the users they follow and have the ability to comment and upvote/downvote any review.
* Logged in users can search for movies, view and edit their own profile, view other users profile (will be implementes in phase2) and can add a moview review of their own.

* Once the admin is logged in, he can see all the movie reviews posted by all the users and has ability to comment, upvote/downvote and remove any movie reviews if the review is not appropriate and has too many spoilers.
* The admin also has the ability to add movies to the database.]
